  All word lists were generated from a huge multi-billion sample of language called a corpus which ensures all topics and text types are covered and the word list reflects how words are used by real users. The word lists include the most common and frequently used words, most frequently used nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions and some additional word lists.
  Longer English word lists of the most frequent and common words can be generated with Sketch Engine. There is no limit for word lists generated from user corpora, however, there is a limit of 1,000 items for word lists generated from preloaded corpora. The user can produce any number of word lists. Advanced filtering criteria using regex can be applied so that the word list contains exactly what the user needs.
